## Overview

An overview of the Longevity Genomics project is given
[here](http://www.longevitygenomics.org/). This site provides links to
technical descriptions of the individual project components in form of
vignettes containing detailed analysis protocols along with well defined
objectives, descriptions of findings and downloads of relevant results. 

## Collaboration and Open Access

To maximize shareability and reproducibility of the data analysis results
generated by this project, most of its analysis routines will be implemented as
R packages hosted on GitHub (_e.g._
[longevityTools](https://github.com/tgirke/longevityTools)).  At a later stage,
suitable components will be contributed to the Bioconductor project. The main
source of documentation for both users and developers are the vignettes and
help files provided by the R packages (for an example see
[here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tgirke/longevityTools/blob/master/vignettes/longevityTools.html){:target="_blank"}).
All analysis results can be fully reproduced by rerunning the commands given in
the vignettes. Instead of regenerating result files from scratch, users can
also download them via URLs provided in the corresponding sections of the
vignettes or directly from the [Downloads]({{site.baseurl}}/downloads/)
page of this site.
While improving transparency for external users, the chosen analysis strategy 
greatly facilitates collaborations among the different teams and members 
of this project. Where appropriate, finalized summary results will be made 
accessible via web-based solutions in the future such as [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) and
[ReportingTools](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/ReportingTools.html).
